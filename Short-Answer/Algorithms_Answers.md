## Exercise I

a)
Line #9: 0(1) or Constant time
Line #10: O(n) or Linear time
Line #11: 0(1) or Constant time

Summary:
Time = 1 + n + 1
O(n)

b)
Line #16: O(1) or Constant time
Line #17: O(n) or Linear time
Line #18: O(1) or Constant time
Line #19: O(n) or Linear time
Line #20: O(1) or Constant time
Line #21: O(1) or Constant time

Summary:
Time = 1 + n + 1 + n + 1 + 1
O(n2)

c)
Line #25: O(1) or Constant time
Line #26: O(1) or Constant time
Line #27: O(1) or Constant time
Line #29: O(n) or Linear time

Summary:
Time = 1 + 1 + 1 + n
O(n)
